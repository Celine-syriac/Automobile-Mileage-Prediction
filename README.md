## Automobile-Mileage-Prediction

This repository contains a linear regression model that accurately predicts the mileage of used cars. The model has been built by leveraging input data and following a structured data analysis process. This readme file provides an overview of the project.

### Project Overview

- **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to predict the mileage of used cars based on various input features.

- **Model:** We have implemented a linear regression model for this task. Linear regression is a simple and effective method for predicting numeric values.

### Key Tasks

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Led the data cleaning and preparation processes to ensure high data quality and reliability for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted thorough EDA to uncover insights and patterns in the dataset. This step helped us understand the relationships between the input features and the target variable (mileage).

3. **Model Training:**
   - Successfully trained the linear regression model, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 70%.
